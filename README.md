# Detection-of--parkinson-s-disease
This repository contains code that uses CNN algorithm to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease.

One of the most serious progressive neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease primarily affects the motor system. Due to PD's close resemblance to other neurological disorders, the precise diagnosis of PD has until now been difficult. These same traits account for 25% of the errors in manual PD diagnosis. In this study, we provide an autonomous diagnosis method that distinguishes between PD and healthy control using convolutional neural networks. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are used to assess the performance of the suggested approach. When compared to various current methodologies, the CNN archive performed better from 3% to 9% in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, according to the thorough comparison in the result section.
